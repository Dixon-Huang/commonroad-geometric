# Parameters for traffic rules
###
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#   - a_abrupt: acceleration difference which indicates abrupt braking
#   - min_velocity_dif: minimum velocity difference
#   - standstill_error: velocity deviation from zero which is still classified to be standstill
#   - num_veh_congestion: minimum number of slow-moving leading vehicles so that a vehicle can be assumed to be part of a congestion
#   - max_congestion_velocity: maximum velocity of a vehicle withing a congestion
#   - max_velocity_limit_free_driving:
#   - desired_interstate_velocity: desired velocity on interstates
#   - min_interstate_width: minimum interstate width so that emergency lane can be created
